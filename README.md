# identify_customer_segment

In this project, I apply unsupervised learning techniques, PCA and Clustering, to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. 

I first create composite variables using general demographic data, and generate clusters. Then, I categorize the customers in the core customer base data into the pre-determined clusters. Finally, I compare the proportion of each cluster in the general demographic data and in the core customer base data to identify which clusters are overrperesented or underrepresented. This helps ascertain which type of customers typically respond to the company's marketing mails versus which type of customers do not respond.
